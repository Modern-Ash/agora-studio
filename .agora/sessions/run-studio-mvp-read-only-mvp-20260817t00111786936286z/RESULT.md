    Read the Agora session context from the path in AGORA_CONTEXT. Follow its operational Markdown, perform only the next action permitted for the assigned role, persist artifacts and evidence through Agora, and stop at human approval or unavailable authority.

    I’m using the Agora execution skill to load the governed session, identify the assigned role and exact permitted transition, then perform only that action. I’ll stop if the protocol reaches a human gate or requires authority this session does not have.

    # Execute governed work
    
    Use `agora next --actor "$AGORA_ACTOR"` to derive the current action from durable Method Pack state.
    When launched through `agora run`, read the context at `AGORA_CONTEXT` before changing the project.
    Record at least one governed transition, artifact, evidence, approval, block, or delegation outcome
    before exiting successfully; a bounded `--until-blocked` controller stops when no durable progress is
    detected. Never select a rework edge merely to avoid a higher-priority human decision.
    Treat the timeout and output limits in `AGORA_SESSION` as immutable execution policy. The controller
    records bounded process output in the session `RESULT.md`; place material outcomes in governed work
    artifacts and evidence rather than relying on that process log.
    
    Identify the active swarm, actor, assignment, work item, and current Method Pack state. Inspect the
    outgoing transition edges and perform only the selected edge using tools allowed to that role.
    Respect WIP limits and gates. Persist material decisions, interactions, artifacts, evidence, and
    approvals. Invoke installed external operations through `agora tool invoke` so their attribution and
    results are durable. When an operation requires an environment, select a policy from
    `.agora/environments`, confirm the assigned role permits it, and satisfy its approvals and evidence.
    When a runtime or reviewed adapter reports measured resource consumption, append it with
    `agora usage add` and cite the authoritative telemetry reference. Never estimate or invent usage.
    Check `agora usage status --swarm <swarm> --work <work>` before allocating or launching bounded
    work so the next operation fits the durable remaining budget.
    When work is delegated, read the related `DELEGATION.md` and act only within its parent or child
    contract. Do not invent a transition or bypass a gate.
    
    When repository history is required, read `.agora/STANDARDS.md` and use the governed
    `repository/commit` operation with a Conventional Commits 1.0.0 message. Do not bypass its input
    validation with an ungoverned Git command.
    
    If active work cannot proceed, use an authorized block with an explicit reason instead of inventing
    a Method Pack state. Do not mutate blocked or cancelled work. Resume only after its stated blocker is
    resolved. Treat delegation rejection as child authority and delegation cancellation as parent
    authority; neither operation permits silently rewriting independently owned child work.

    ## Principles
    
    - Humans and agents follow the same role contracts.
    - Every external action is attributable to an actor and role.
    - Work advances only when the active Method Pack permits it.
    - Project language, runtime, LLM, and development process are configuration, not core assumptions.
    - Decisions, handoffs, artifacts, and evidence remain reviewable in Git.
    - Production-impacting actions require an explicit project policy.
    - Environment-aware Tool Runs must bind a stable project environment separately from provider
      target inputs and credentials.
    - Cross-host writer coordination may use a reviewed external lease CLI, but work truth remains in
      the filesystem and Git.
    - Recursive delegation must remain acyclic and within the configured maximum depth.
    - Repository commits follow every active standard in `.agora/STANDARDS.md`, including Conventional
      Commits 1.0.0.
    
    ## Local amendments
    
    Record project-specific engineering, security, compliance, and approval rules here.

    ---
    
    # Collaboration protocol
    
    1. Read `.agora/project.md`, this protocol, the constitution, and the active Method Pack.
    2. Identify the active swarm, assigned role, current work state, and allowed tools.
    3. Do not act outside the capabilities and permissions of the assignment.
    4. Record material interactions and decisions in the active swarm.
    5. Register produced artifacts and evidence before requesting completion.
    6. Use a handoff when responsibility moves between a human, AI agent, service, or swarm.
    7. Use a delegation record when linked child work is proposed, accepted, or collected.
    8. Stop and request approval when a policy or gate cannot be satisfied.
    9. Use installed Tool Pack operations for governed external actions and retain their results.
    10. Read `.agora/STANDARDS.md` and validate commit messages before creating repository history.
    11. When an actor requires authentication, prepare, externally sign, and apply each covered
        lifecycle mutation through its durable `ACTION.md` intent.
    12. For environment-aware Tool Runs, select a project environment and satisfy its role, approval,
        and evidence policy before preparation and again before launch.
    13. When `.agora/coordination.md` selects an external lease, do not bypass the Agora mutation path;
        local and distributed writer coordination are cumulative.
    
    The repository and its active branch are the shared source of truth. Chat history is not durable
    project state unless its relevant outcome is recorded in Agora files.

    standards: ["conventional-commits/v1.0.0"]
    ---
    
    # Project standards
    
    ## Conventional Commits 1.0.0
    
    Every Git commit created for governed work must use:
    
    ```text
    <type>[optional scope][!]: <description>
    
    [optional body]
    
    [optional footer(s)]
    ```
    
    Use `feat` for a new feature and `fix` for a bug fix. Other descriptive types such as `docs`, `test`,
    `refactor`, `build`, `ci`, and `chore` are allowed. Mark breaking changes with `!` before `:` or an
    uppercase `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. A body or footer must begin after a blank line.
    
    Use the governed `repository/commit` Tool Pack operation when the acting role has
    `repository.write`. Agora validates its `message` input before Git is invoked. Project amendments may
    restrict types or scopes further, but must not weaken the Conventional Commits 1.0.0 structure.

    schema: "agora/tool-policy/v1"
    default: "deny-unregistered"
    ---
    
    # Tool policy
    
    Tools include local commands and external systems such as repositories, Jira, CI/CD, Confluence,
    cloud providers, observability platforms, and communication services.
    
    ## Rules
    
    - Authentication remains in the environment, keychain, or external secret manager.
    - Agora stores integration references, never raw credentials.
    - Read and write capabilities are granted separately.
    - Destructive, merge, release, and production actions require explicit policy and evidence.
    - Method Packs and role policies may further restrict this catalog.
    - Environment-aware operations require an admitted project environment; role capability,
      environment capability, approvals, and evidence are cumulative restrictions.
    - Invoke installed operations through `agora tool invoke` so attribution and results remain durable.
    - Prefer a reviewed native CLI adapter already used by the developer, then a reviewed team wrapper;
      use MCP only when it provides a required capability unavailable through the CLI.
    - Discovering an executable must never install an adapter, change transport, or grant authority.
    - A partial adapter must declare its exact implemented operations and must not imply unsupported
      write or destructive behavior.
    - Create commits through `repository/commit`; its message must satisfy the configured Conventional
      Commits input rule.
    - Use `agora tool sync` only for explicit read operations; synchronization must never mutate an
      external provider or bypass normal Tool Run persistence.
    
    ## Project tools
    
    | Tool | Capabilities | Authentication reference | Approval |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | repository | `repository.read`, `repository.write` | local Git configuration | operation policy |
    | repository-governance | `repository.governance.read` | external repository profile | read-only |
    | work-management | `issue.read`, `issue.write`, `issue.transition` | external CLI profile | role capability |
    | ci-cd | `ci.read`, `ci.run`, `ci.cancel`, `deployment.create` | external CI/CD CLI profile | role capability and operation policy |
    | release-management | `release.read`, `release.publish` | external release profile | publication is opt-in |
    | security-scanning | `security.read` | least-privilege security profile | read-only and redacted |
    | portfolio-management | `portfolio.read`, `portfolio.write` | external portfolio profile | owner role capability |
    | knowledge-base | `docs.read`, `docs.write`, `docs.publish`, `docs.archive` | external documentation CLI profile | role capability and operation policy |
    | cloud-infrastructure | `cloud.read`, `cloud.plan`, `cloud.deploy`, `cloud.destroy` | workload identity | role capability, evidence, and approval policy |
    | observability | `observability.read`, `incident.write`, `incident.resolve` | external observability CLI profile | role capability and incident policy |
    
    Installed Tool Packs live in subdirectories of `.agora/tools`. Presence in this catalog does not
    grant authority; active Method Pack roles must list each allowed tool capability.

    # Spec-Driven Development Method Pack
    
    This pack governs delivery through an explicit specification lifecycle: draft a spec, resolve every
    open question before planning, then plan, implement, and verify against it. It fits a human and an AI
    agent pairing as easily as a solo actor, and needs no sprint cadence or backlog ceremony to work.
    
    ## Completion gate
    
    - All acceptance criteria are satisfied.
    - Every required artifact kind is registered.
    - At least one successful evidence record exists.
    - The Spec Owner has approved.
    # Spec-Driven protocol
    
    The Spec Owner drafts the specification, resolves every open question, and holds final acceptance.
    The Developer plans, implements, and verifies against the accepted specification. A spec cannot leave
    drafting until its criteria are satisfied and a `spec` artifact is registered — clarification is a
    gate, not a convention.
    
    The same actor may hold both roles when project policy allows it, but the two responsibilities stay
    distinguishable: clarifying scope is not the same action as implementing it.
    
    Failed verification returns work to `implementing` for rework rather than inventing a new state; the
    specification does not change mid-cycle without a new draft.
    # Spec-Driven tool restrictions
    
    - The Developer may use repository, CI, and cloud-plan tools permitted by the project.
    - Specification changes require the Spec Owner role.
    - Exceptional workflow paths require an explicit Method Pack transition and gate policy.
    - Merge, release publication, and deployment permissions are never implied by the Developer role.

    Define the user-visible scope and acceptance contract for a local-first, read-only Agora Studio MVP. Planning and implementation remain gated and out of scope for this work.
    
    ## Acceptance criteria
    
    - [x] **scope:** The specification identifies target users, their problem, the MVP outcome, and explicit read-only boundaries.
    - [x] **behavior:** The specification defines observable behavior for opening a project, understanding governance state, inspecting work and evidence, seeing validation and next actions, refreshing data, and handling invalid or incomplete projects.
    - [x] **quality:** The specification defines measurable safety, accessibility, responsiveness, and performance expectations without selecting an implementation stack.
    - [x] **testability:** Every product requirement has concrete acceptance scenarios, and the specification contains no unresolved questions.
    - [x] **non-mutation:** The specification explicitly excludes filesystem, Git, Agora lifecycle, and external-system mutations from the MVP.

    Agora’s only outgoing edge for this role is `implementing → verifying`. The specification is complete, has no open questions, and this work explicitly excludes building the product itself, so the permitted action is to advance the specification work into verification—not to change the spec or start implementation. I’m persisting that single governed transition now.
